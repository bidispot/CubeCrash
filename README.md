# CubeCrash

This is the first 3D mini-game I built with `Unity 2018` inspired by the great work of [Brackets](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA).

This is an arcade game in which you're controlling a cube that is sliding on a quite narrow platform trying to avoid obstacles to reach the finish line.

It's been built for [Windows](https://github.com/bidispot/CubeCrash/blob/master/deliverables/CubeCrash.zip) and [MacOs](https://github.com/bidispot/CubeCrash/tree/master/deliverables)
